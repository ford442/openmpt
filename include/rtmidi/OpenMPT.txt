commit e8ae727b4728b49dad5f9a2c312945148fa25454 from https://github.com/thestk/rtmidi/
Files not used by OpenMPT (config/, doc/, msw/, tests/, build systems, C API)
have been removed from this folder. No further local changes have been made.
License.txt has been extracted from the readme for OpenMPT's license package.

For building, premake is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
See ../build/premake/ for details.
